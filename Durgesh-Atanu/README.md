 In this project, we are providing a farmer friendly web-based app that gives complete information about what crop to grow, what fertilizers and pesticides to use depending upon land condition and weather conditions.
 
 It also provides a platform that connects farmers directly to consumers or retailers thus, eliminates middlemen. This web application can be used by both farmers as well as retailers/consumers accordingly.
